I was absolutely gobsmacked when I discovered that my neighbour had been secretly growing prize-winning marrows in his garden shed all these years. "That's brilliant!" I exclaimed when he finally revealed his hobby. I couldn't believe my eyes when the double-decker bus swerved to avoid a squirrel and ended up knocking over the postbox on the corner of Worthington Road. The driver was proper good about it though, checking if everyone was alright before ringing the authorities.
After queuing for nearly three hours outside the theatre in the pouring rain, we were informed that the performance had been cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances. "Are you taking the mick?" I heard someone mutter behind me. I was absolutely knackered by this point, so I decided I was just popping to the shops for a quick snack. "Mind the gap," announced the tube speaker as I made my way to the high street.
The local chippy on the high street has been serving the most scrumptious fish and chips to the village for more than fifty years, and they still use the same secret batter recipe. "Fancy a cuppa?" asked the owner as I waited for my order. Would you mind awfully if I borrowed your brolly? I've just noticed it's started chucking it down and I've got to dash across to the Post Office before it closes.
After a fortnight of dreadful weather, we finally had a proper summer's day, perfect for a picnic on the village green and a spot of cricket. "I'll give you a ring later," I told my friend as we parted ways. We're heading to the Lake District next weekend for a proper holiday, and I'm rather hoping the weather will be kind enough to allow for some decent walking. Her Majesty's Royal Garden Party at Buckingham Palace was simply splendid, with cucumber sandwiches and proper English tea served on the finest bone china. "Shall we queue here?" I asked another guest, maintaining that quintessentially British orderliness even in the presence of royalty.
